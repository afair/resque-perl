Resque-Perl version 0.01
===================

Resque-Perl is a more-or-less straight port of Resque from Ruby to Perl. 
Resque (https://github.com/defunkt/resque), "is a Redis-backed library for creating 
background jobs, placing those jobs on multiple queues, and processing them later"

Resque utilizes Redis. (http://redis.io/) "Redis is an open source, advanced key-value store. 
It is often referred to as a data structure server since keys can contain strings, 
hashes, lists, sets and sorted sets." Resque is not a flash-in-the-pan NoSQL datastore,
but offers a real solution, particularly to fast-access and transient data.

I created this port in order to interoperate between Perl and Ruby systems. The
design of Resque is more Ruby-centric, and I have relaxed the protocol in order for
Perl to easily create and process queues.


INSTALLATION

First, you need Redis (http://redis.io/) installed and running. Queue data is stored 
in Redis, and you may want to configure Redis for your particular persistence needs.

You do not need Ruby or Resque to use Resque-Perl, but they should work together.

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

  Test

THANK YOU'S

Thanks to the great team at Github for creating Resque, a powerful, elegant queueing solution
where AMQP-based queues may be overkill.

Also thanks to the developers of the Redis key-value store.
